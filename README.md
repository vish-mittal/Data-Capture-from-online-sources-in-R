# Data Capture from Online Sources

## Introduction:
In this project, we will  demonstrate how to capture data from online sources (i.e., web scraping), and cleaning and wrangling data using R. This assignment is divided into three main parts:
- First, we will need to collect the information using web scraping techniques learned in this unit.
- Second, we will need to clean and wrangle the scraped data.
- Third, answer research questions using R.

We will need to collect specific data from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). This organisation supports the preservation of the world’s natural and cultural heritage. As of today (April 2022), there are more than 1100 heritage sites around the world, most of which are man-made like the Acropolis of Athens or the Taj Mahal in India, but also natural sites like the Great Barrier Reef here in Australia are listed. Unfortunately, some of the sites in the list are threatened by human intervention or natural reasons. We want to know more about the endangered sites, their location, and the reasons that put a site at risk.

This project is divided in three parts, in the first part we will collect data from a website; in the second part, we will clean and wrangling the data; and in the third part, we will answer some questions using the data.

For this project, we will use the website of the list of currently and previously endangered sites in Wikipedia. This site can be accessed at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Heritage_in_Danger. You will scrape the table with the current endangered sites, which contains information about the sites and their reasons to be in the list, e.g., their name, location, type of threat that is facing the site. Now, let’s collect some specific information about the sites to answer some questions.
